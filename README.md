- Linux: `~/Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods`

## Understanding the Results

The tool categorizes conflicts by severity:

- 游댮 High: >100 shared resources - Mods likely incompatible, remove one
- 游리 Medium: 10-100 shared resources - Mods may have issues, test in game
- 游릭 Low: <10 shared resources - Minor conflicts, probably safe

The CSV report provides detailed information about:
- Which mods conflict with each other
- Number of shared resources
- Types of resources in conflict
- Recommended actions

### Error Messages
